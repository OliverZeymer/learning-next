# Metaversus

Welcome to my first Next.js project **Metaversus**. Metaversus is a design i found on Figma and thought i'd give it a shot with Next.js, TailwindCSS and Framer motion. I used the beta version of Next.js 13 with the App directory router to try it out, and it was a really fun developer experience! In the future i wanna add data fetching and add some SEO practices since that's where Next.js shines and i'm really interested in SEO.
